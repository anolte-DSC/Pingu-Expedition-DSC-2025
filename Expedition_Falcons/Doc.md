# Falcons in ZARM

The ZARM drop tower has a long history of giving epic flying birds a place to stay and breed.
This year the peregrine falcon already laid one egg and names are up to be suggested.

The expedition also shows that in the last years other types of falcons found refuge in the drop tower.
